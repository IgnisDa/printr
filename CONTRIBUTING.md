## Making commits to the repository

To make it easier to make [conventional
commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), we use
[Gitzer](https://github.com/IgnisDa/Gitzer) to make our commits (_DISCLAIMER_: I am the
author of this tool).

You are not required to use the tool, as long as your commit messages follow the
conventional commit style.

## Issues

Issues are very valuable to this project.

- Ideas are a valuable source of contributions others can make
- Problems show where this project is lacking
- With a question you show where contributors can improve the user experience

Thank you for creating them.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following things:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your
contribution.

For example:

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always
> look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me
the action you have taken to solve it.

### Does it follow the contributor covenant

This repository has a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), things that do not
respect it will be removed.

## After contributing to this repository
