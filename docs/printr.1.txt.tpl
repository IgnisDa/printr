Name
----
printr - the smarter echo alternative

Synopsis
--------
printr [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [STRING]...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
printr(1) is meant to be a drop in replacement for the everyday shell command - echo(1). Though
coloring is supported by echo(1), it is un-intuitive and often not cross-platform. Enter printr,
a cross platform command that does all that echo(1) does, and a bit more.

It supports coloring as well as styling your output via simple command line flags. Most of
the time, however, supplying these flags is not required since printr(1) is smart enough to
figure out the input STRING's sentiment via some naive sentiment analysis.
